  # Create storage bucket for content files

  1. Storage Setup
    - Create 'content' storage bucket for file uploads
    - Set bucket to public for easy access to uploaded files

  2. Security
    - Add RLS policies for bucket access
    - Users can upload to their own folders
    - Users can read their own files
    - Admins can read all files
