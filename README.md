## üöÄ Overview

The Digital Marketing Content Hub is a full-stack web application that bridges the gap between content creators and marketing teams.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** for version control
- A **Supabase** account (free tier available)

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd digital-marketing-content-hub
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings > API to get your project credentials
3. Copy your project URL and anon key
4. **Configure Google OAuth** (for Google sign-in):
    - Go to Authentication > Providers in your Supabase dashboard
    - Enable Google provider
    - Add your Google OAuth credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
    - Set the redirect URL to: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Superadmin Configuration (Change these in production!)
SUPERADMIN_MASTER_KEY=your_secure_master_key_2024
SUPERADMIN_SECRET=your_super_secret_hash_key_2024
```

### 5. Set Up Database

The application includes pre-built migrations. In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to the SQL Editor
2. Run the migration files in order (they're located in `supabase/migrations/`)
3. Or use the Supabase CLI if you have it installed:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```

### 6. Configure Storage

In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Storage
2. The `content` bucket should be created automatically by the migrations
3. Verify the bucket is set to public access

### 7. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## üìñ Usage

### Client Workflow

1. **Account Creation**
    - Visit the homepage and click "Create Account" under Client Portal
    - Choose to sign up with Google or fill out the registration form with required details
    - Sign in to access your dashboard

2. **Store Setup**
    - On first login, you'll be prompted to set up your store details
    - Enter store name, brand/company, address, and optional coordinates
    - Save to proceed to content upload

3. **Content Upload**
    - Use the drag-and-drop interface to select files
    - Set content title, start/end dates, and recurrence options
    - Upload and track your content in the dashboard

### Administrator Workflow

1. **Admin Access**
    - Create an admin account or sign in via the Admin Dashboard link (supports Google OAuth)
    - Access the centralized content management interface

2. **Content Management**
    - View all client content organized by location or company
    - Use filtering options to find specific content
    - Preview media files directly in the browser
    - Monitor campaign schedules and recurrence patterns

### Superadmin Access

For system administration and emergency access:

1. **Generate Access Key**
    - Visit `/superadmin` in your browser
    - Enter your master key (from environment variables)
    - Generate a time-limited superadmin key

2. **Bypass Authentication**
    - Use the generated key as a URL parameter: `/admin?superadmin_key=YOUR_KEY`
    - Or include it as a header: `x-superadmin-key: YOUR_KEY`
    - Access expires after 24 hours

## üîê Authorization & User Validation

### Authentication Flow

The application uses a multi-layered authentication system:

1. **Supabase Auth**: Handles user registration, login, and session management
    - **Email/Password**: Traditional authentication with secure password requirements
    - **Google OAuth**: One-click sign-in with Google accounts
2. **Role-Based Access**: Users are assigned either 'client' or 'admin' roles
3. **Route Protection**: Middleware validates user roles before granting access
4. **Database Security**: Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures data isolation

### User Roles

- **Client**: Can upload content, manage their stores, view their own uploads
- **Admin**: Can view all content across all clients, organize campaigns
- **Superadmin**: Emergency access that bypasses normal authentication

### Security Features

- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with mixed case and numbers
- **OAuth Integration**: Secure Google authentication with proper redirect handling
- **Session Management**: Automatic session refresh and secure cookie handling
- **File Access Control**: Users can only access their own uploaded files
- **Database Isolation**: RLS policies prevent cross-user data access
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged with timestamps and user IDs

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | Yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase anonymous key | Yes |
| `SUPERADMIN_MASTER_KEY` | Master key for generating superadmin access | Yes |
| `SUPERADMIN_SECRET` | Secret for superadmin key validation | Yes |

### Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:
- `profiles`: User information and roles
- `stores`: Client store/location data
- `content`: Uploaded marketing content with metadata
- `storage.objects`: File storage managed by Supabase

### File Upload Limits

- **Supported Formats**: Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF), Videos (MP4, MOV, AVI), Audio (MP3, WAV, AAC)
- **File Size**: No explicit limit set (controlled by Supabase storage limits)
- **Storage**: Files are stored in Supabase Storage with public access URLs
